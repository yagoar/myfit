# Measurement recipes

Reference for picking the right primitive when wiring a new Seamly
code into `seamly_catalog.py::RECIPES`. All primitives live in
`src/tailor_twin/measure/primitives.py`. Every recipe is a frozen
dataclass with a `compute(verts, faces, landmarks) -> float` returning
centimetres.

## Selection cheat-sheet

| Tape mental model | Primitive |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Straight-line distance landmark→landmark | `LandmarkChord` |
| Straight 3D yardstick visiting N landmarks | `PolylineChord` |
| Vertical drop from a landmark to a Y plane | `VerticalDrop` |
| Vertical distance floor → landmark | `Height` |
| Horizontal taut tape around the torso | `PlanarGirth` |
| Front (or back) arc only of a horizontal slice | `PlanarArc` |
| Widest X-extent of a horizontal slice | `LateralChord` |
| Circumference of a limb, square to its axis | `LimbGirth` |
| Geodesic on the body through ordered points | `Geodesic` (open) / `GeodesicLoop` (closed) |
| Vertical tape clinging to body at fixed X | `SurfacePlumb` |
| As above, then straight chord to a landmark | `SurfacePlumbThenDrop` |
| Diagonal surface tape between two points, tilted vertical plane | `DiagonalSurfacePlumb` |

| Arithmetic over already-computed codes | `Formula` (see `seamly_catalog.py::FORMULAS`) |

## Recipe details

### `Height(landmark)`
Vertical floor→landmark distance. Floor = `verts[:,1].min()`.
Failure: none — always defined.

### `LandmarkChord(a, b, straight=False)`
3D euclidean distance between two landmarks. `straight=True` opts out
of surface-drape in the viz: line is rendered as the literal 3D
chord (with a small normal offset) instead of being snapped to the
body. Use for tapes pulled in space (e.g. apex→waist).

### `PolylineChord(landmarks, straight=False)`
Sum of euclidean distances between consecutive landmarks.

### `VerticalDrop(landmark, target_y_landmark)`
Vertical 3D distance: |landmark.y - target_y_landmark.y|. Value is
the Y delta; visualisation drops straight from the landmark to its
Y-projected counterpart.

### `PlanarGirth(landmark, regions=("torso",))`
Convex-hull perimeter of the horizontal slice at `landmark.y`. The
`regions` mask keeps arms / legs out of torso slices. Picks the
torso loop when multiple loops survive the slice.
Failure: empty slice (rare, e.g. floor anchor below the mesh).

### `PlanarArc(landmark_plane, clip_start, clip_end, side, regions=("torso",))`
A horizontal slice arc clipped between two landmarks on the loop.
`side="front"` picks the higher-Z (anterior) arc; `"back"` the
lower-Z. Value is arc length along the body contour.

### `LateralChord(landmark, regions=("torso",))`
Max X-extent (loop[:,0].max - .min) of the horizontal slice at the
landmark plane.

### `LimbGirth(landmark, axis_from, axis_to, regions=(), radius_m=None)`
Convex-hull perimeter of the slice perpendicular to the limb axis
`(axis_from → axis_to)` at `landmark`. `axis_from`/`axis_to` accept
landmark names or `joint.<NAME>` (e.g. `joint.L_Shoulder`).
`radius_m`: extra mask that keeps only vertices within that radius
of `landmark` — needed for bent-arm slices where region masks alone
let in opposite-side body parts.
Failure: degenerate axis (norm < EPS_AXIS_NORM) → ValueError.

### `Geodesic(waypoints, via=True, smooth=False)`
Open surface path through ordered waypoints. `via=True` chains
pairwise geodesics so every waypoint is visited (use this for
constraints); `via=False` calls `find_geodesic_path_poly` which may
skip past intermediate waypoints (faster but only valid when
waypoints are hints). `smooth=True` applies Gaussian filtering on
the resulting polyline to round V-kinks at chained-segment joins —
keep off unless the kink shows up in the viewer.
Failure: solver exception → NaN.

### `GeodesicLoop(waypoints)`
Closed loop through waypoints. Chained pairwise (always `via`),
guaranteed to visit every waypoint — unlike `find_geodesic_loop`
which iteratively shortens past them.

### `SurfacePlumb(start, target_y_landmark, side="front", x_band=0.015, y_band=0.006)`
Vertical strip on the body surface at fixed X = `start.x`. Slices
the body with a vertical plane perpendicular to X; takes the
front-half (or back) loop from Y=start.y to Y=target_y_landmark.y.
Pure planar slice — no per-Y nearest-vertex zigzag.

### `SurfacePlumbThenDrop(start, mold_y_landmark, target_y_landmark=None, end_landmark=None, side="front")`
`SurfacePlumb` down to the mold Y, then a straight chord to either
`end_landmark` (preferred) or a vertical drop at the surface
endpoint's X/Z to `target_y_landmark.y`.

### `DiagonalSurfacePlumb(start, end, side="front", mold_y_landmark=None, chord_endpoint=None, truncate=False, smooth=False)`
Surface strip whose slicing plane contains the chord(start, end)
AND is parallel to Z (vertical, tilted to align with the front-view
diagonal). Front-view projection of the curve is the straight
diagonal start→end; in 3D the curve hugs the body in Z. Optional
`mold_y_landmark`: contour the body above that Y, then straight
chord below. Optional `chord_endpoint`: end the chord at a different
landmark (e.g. waist_cf for H06). `truncate=True`: stop at the arc
(no trailing chord).

### `DiagonalYardstick(start, end, mid_y_landmark, side="front", y_band=0.012)`
Three-point yardstick. Mid touch point = body surface vertex at
`mid_y_landmark.y` nearest (in X/Z) to where the straight chord
crosses that Y. Models a tape stretched start→end that falls
against the bust line.

### `GeodesicThenDrop(waypoints, target_y_landmark)`
Surface geodesic through waypoints, then straight vertical chord
from the last waypoint to `target_y_landmark.y` at the last point's
X/Z. Used for outseam-style tapes (waist→side→floor).

### `HybridLoop(plane_landmark, planar_side, arc_endpoints, geodesic_waypoints=(), regions=("torso",))`
Half horizontal-planar arc on one side of the body, half geodesic
on the other. Used when one half of a girth should stay parallel
to the floor (back) while the other half curves over a bulge
(front, over the bust).

### `TapeLoop(plane_landmark, side_endpoints, front_waypoints=None, regions=("torso",))`
Closed highbust-style loop. Back = planar slice at `plane_landmark.y`
convex-hulled from L→R via CB. Front = either the front half of the
same planar slice (if `front_waypoints is None`) or a geodesic
through `front_waypoints` between the side endpoints.

### `SmoothLoop(waypoints)`
Periodic cubic B-spline (splprep, per=True) through anchor
landmarks. Each spline sample is replaced with the nearest body
vertex (small outward normal offset for viz). Tape that touches the
anatomical anchors AND hugs the body between them, no V-dips.

### `Formula(expr)` *(see `seamly_catalog.py::FORMULAS`)*
Arithmetic over already-computed Seamly codes. `expr` is a Python
expression evaluated with locals = `{code: value_cm}` and an empty
`__builtins__`. Use for derivations like `L03 = L01 - L02`.

## Failure modes summary

| Site | Returns | When |
|------|---------|------|
| `Geodesic*.compute` | NaN | solver raises (catches `Exception`) |
| `LimbGirth.compute` | NaN | ConvexHull degenerate / slice empty |
| `*.compute` (planar) | NaN | slice produces no loop / band < 3 pts |
| `DiagonalSurfacePlumb._path` | None → NaN | degenerate chord, t-bins all empty |
| `_get_solver` | builds new solver | re-runs are cached by `id(verts)` |

## Drape behaviour (visualisation)

`recipe_polyline(recipe, ...)` returns the 3D curve to display.
Recipes in `DRAPE_ON_BODY_RECIPES` (`LandmarkChord`, `VerticalDrop`,
`PolylineChord`) get their straight chords replaced with the geodesic
between their endpoints UNLESS `straight=True` is set on the
recipe — used when the measurement IS the yardstick line (the value
is the chord length, the viz should show the chord).
